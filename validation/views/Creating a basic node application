Creating a basic node application
=================================
1.installing express after installing node
Installing express
->npm install express --save

2.installing express generator
what is express generator?
	To create modular structure of folders of our app we use express generator
->npm install -g express-generator

3.Go to any path you want to create application. To start an application.
->express appname
where appname is your application
ex:
->express validation

3.Installing other dependencies.
Go to your current application i.e. 'validation' in current example and type following command.
->npm install 
will install all dependencies in package.json

4.starting application.
->npm start

4.Installing nodemon
Nodemon restarts the server automatically whenever you save a file that the server uses. 
->npm install nodemon --save-dev

Note: instead of calling 'node server.js' in cmd we now call 'nodemon start' to listen any changes in server files.
